# Resume

This started as just a simple place to store a markdown format of my resume, and now it's turned into an easy way to host your resume using [sinatra][s], [github-pages][gp] or [Heroku][h].

[gp]: http://pages.github.com/
[h]: http://heroku.com/

## Installation

 1. Fork this project
 2. Modify resume.md to be your resume.
 3. Modify config.yaml so that the data represents you, not icco.
 4. Edit views/style.less to make your resume look pretty.
 5. Install the gems [sinatra][s], [github-markup][gm], [git][g], [rack-test][rt] and [heroku][h]. The easiest way to do this is `gem install bundler && bundle install`
   * install the correct parser for [github-markup][gm], such as [rdiscount][r] for [Markdown][md].
 6. type `rake local` or `./resume.rb` to run locally.
 7. To deploy to Heroku
   * Run `heroku create`
   * `rake deploy` to push your resume to the internet.
 8. To deploy to [github-pages][gp], run `rake github`.

## Other cool stuff

My idea is pretty simple, I just wanted a plain text resume and an easy way to host it. [Dan Mayer][dm] took this idea and ran with it. He made a lot of really cool changes, and although I love simplicity, what I really love is how much he abstracted my original design. You should really check out his resume, and some of the forks of it.
